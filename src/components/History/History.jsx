                <p>The island Hispaniola (La Isla Espanola)was the first colony in the New World settled by Spain.</p>
                <p>As such, i served as the logistical base for the conquest of most of the Western
                    Hemisphere.Christopher Columbus first sighted the island in 1492 toward the
                    end of his first voyage to"the Indies."

                <p>For two centuries Spanish ruled the island until western Hispaniola
                    (present-day Hait)came under French control in 1697. The east still remained
                    under Spanish contral. This created a division that still exists today, with the
                    Dominican Repubilc and Haiti sharing island.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, and after decades of unstable political situtions, on 27 February 1844,
                    the territory of Santo Domingo recovered its sovereignty and declared its
                    independence as the Dominican Repubilc.
